\arguments{
\item{d}{Dimension of generated matrix. If not informed, \code{d} = 10}

\item{method}{The method of matrix generation.
\itemize{
 \item "\code{random}": generates a random matrix with the given dimension;
 \item "\code{low}": generates a matrix of values between \code{-lim_low} and   \code{lim_low};
 \item "\code{medium}": generates a matrix of values in the interval \eqn{[-lim_medium, -lim_low) U (lim_low, lim_medium)};
 \item "\code{high}": generates a matrix os values between \code{lim_medium} and 1.
 \item "\code{custom}": Generates a matrix given the custom limits and custom proportions on each band defined by the limits.
}}

\item{custom_prop}{A vector with custom proportions for every band defined by \code{lim_low} and \code{lim_medium} or \code{custom_lim}. If not defined, the proportions will be equally distributed among the correlation bands.}

\item{nsim}{Size of vectors used to generate the correlation matrix.}

\item{lim_low}{Defines the lower limit of generated correlations. Applied in \code{low} and \code{medium} methods by standard and in \code{custom} method if \code{custom_lim} are not informed.}

\item{lim_medium}{Defines the medium limit of generated correlations. Applied in \code{low} and \code{medium} methods and in \code{custom} method if \code{custom_lim} are not informed.}

\item{custom_lim}{A number or numeric vector with customized limits to generate the correlation matrix.}

\item{signal}{Defines if the signals of correlation matrix must be choosed at random or all must be positive.
\itemize{
 \item "\code{positive}": generates a correlation matrix with all correlations positive. Some negative signals may occur for correlations sufficiently near         zero.
 \item "\code{random}": generates a correlation matrix with random signals
}}

\item{custom_precision}{The precision used in \code{custom} method. it's the maximum difference between \code{custom_prop} and the proportions generated by the function}

\item{custom_nrep}{Number of iterations in optimization method used to generate custom correlation matrices.}

\item{sort_intensity}{Sorts the correlation matrix by intensity.}

\item{random_liminf}{Sets the lower limit of uniform distribution that generates the standard deviations used in random correlation matrix generation. Must be greater than zero due convergence problems.}
}
\description{
Generates custom correlation matrices based on user defined limits and/or proportions.
}
\details{
This method generates correlation matrices based on the correlations among random normal variables with mean 0 and specified standard deviation values. These specified standard deviation values makes possible the control of the correlation coefficients intensity.
